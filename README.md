# Spitter

Spitter is the most minimalistic writing tool you can get. It:

* only shows you the recently written stream of text.

* only allows deleting the most recent words, no editing.

* Spits whatever you have written to a file which it will never load again.

**VERY EARLY DEVELOPMENT**

To try it, install [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) and run `racket main.rkt`.
